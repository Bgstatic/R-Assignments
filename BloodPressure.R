### PART 1

**Age = ** Quantative and discrete, because the age takes on numerical value and the age is also integer.

**Systolic Blood Pressure = ** Quantative and continuous, because the systolic blood pressure takes on numerical value and the systolic blood pressure could be decimal.

**Diastolic Blood Pressure = ** Quantative and continuous, because the diastolic blood pressure takes on numerical value and the diastolic blood pressure could be decimal.

The data are also multivariate, because we are observing more than two variables for every individual.

### PART 2

We determined that all variables were Quantative variables. So we can use relative frequency histogram, stem and leaf, histograms and dot plots to describe the dataset.


### PART 3

**The z-score of the diastolic blood pressure of the women's -->**
```{r, echo=FALSE}
Diastolic_women_Z_Score = (Diastolic_Women_Data - Diastolic_Women_Mean) / Diastolic_Women_Standart_Deviation
summary(Diastolic_women_Z_Score)
```
Any z-score greater than 3 or less than -3 is considered to be an outlier. This rule of thumb is based on the empirical rule. We cannot consider z-scores as an outliyer for diastolic blood pressure of the women's
